# Shell Streaming

How the shell (`.a`, `.af`, `.aa` and the guest shell in
`stdplugins/advanced_get.py`) runs commands so that their output can be shown
while they run, and stopped. This file describes the producers: the code that
runs a command and collects its bytes. The chat side (the live preview, `.k`,
the Stop button and `/settings`) builds on them and is not written yet.

## Shell pools

Brish keeps long-lived zsh workers ready; a set of them in one `Brish` object
is a **pool**. The bot has two:

- The **shell pool**, `util.persistent_brish`: `borg_brish_count` workers (16
  by default), started at import. `.a`, `.af` and the guest shell run here,
  and the plugin passes it explicitly (`brish=util.persistent_brish`).
- The **plugin pool**, `util.plugin_brish()`: `borg_plugin_brish_count`
  workers (4 by default), started on its first use. `brishz`,
  `brishz_capture` and `brishz_helper` default to it, so `jlib_plugins/jlib2.py`,
  `stdplugins/tex2png.py`, `stdplugins/ptv.py` (through `aget_brishz`) and
  `stdplugins/ebook_processor.py` run here.

Both pools boot with `util.BRISH_BOOT_CMD` (`JBRISH=y`).

Why two: with brish 0.4.0, a pool restarts after one of its workers dies (a
stopped command that needed SIGKILL, or `exit N` in a non-fork `.af`), and
that restart waits for the lock of every worker of the pool, so for every
command still running there, an endless one included. On one shared pool, a
stubborn `.a tail -f` would block `.tex` until it ended. With two pools, a
restart of either never stalls the other.

`.x`, `.sbb` and `.xf` call `util.init_brishes`, which starts a new shell pool
and retires both old pools on `util.executor`. The plugin pool is not started
again there; the next plugin command starts it. A retired pool shuts down once
the commands still running on it end.

Nothing here depends on whole-pool restarts. Brish 0.4.1 is announced to
restart only the dead worker; the separate plugin pool is still worth keeping
until the bot runs it.
