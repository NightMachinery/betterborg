"""
Repackages messages sent in quick succession into a reply chain.

This plugin is active by default in all chats. It buffers incoming messages
for a short duration (1 second). Once the batch of messages is collected,
the originals are deleted, and their content is resent as a clean reply
chain, correctly handling text, media, and albums.
