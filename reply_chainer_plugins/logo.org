Excellent point. The core function is key. Here are several prompts designed to visually represent the concept of "linking replies" or "creating a chain," while still adhering to the minimalist-yet-intricate aesthetic.

*** Theme 1: Weaving & Stitching
This theme uses the metaphor of threads connecting separate items into a whole, representing the creation of a coherent conversation.
