* Make the bot work in groups
** should only activate when the message starts with `@{bot_username}`
*** should strip this prefix from messages when constructing the history
*** should add metadata of each message (user id, name, timestamp, forwarded from where) at the start of each message

* history_util

I am now trying to store message ids on new events as a workaround for getting previous messages. But events.NewMessage() seems to filter out the messages the bot itself is sending. How do I also include those?

I am using @client.on(events.NewMessage(outgoing=True)) for catching the messages the bot itself is sending, but it doesn't trigger.
